  <p class="m-5 h3 text-warning">Access To The Website</p>
  <p class="ml-5 mr-5 ">Upon registration, Tenantverify grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive license to access its Website and the information contained or uploaded on the databases, solely for the purpose of carrying out data verification, person, business contact, company search, address/location and related searches. Access is hereby granted for qualified individual use only. Tenantverify may authorize broader enterprise business use through its enterprise services program, by way of a separate agreement which will need to be entered into between the enterprise and Tenantverify. While Tenantverify uses reasonable efforts to collate information on its database from information gathered from selected public records and other sources, such as by way of physical verification, enquiries, etc., you hereby agree and accept that all information on the Website is provided “AS IS”. Furthermore, Tenantverify accesses and is charged for information controlled by third parties and therefore cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information.</p>
  <p class="m-5 h3 text-warning">General Restrictions</p>
  <p class="ml-5 mr-5">You agree to use and seek information only for appropriate, legal purposes, and in compliance with all applicable national, state and local laws and regulations. Additionally, you agree that the Website and information contained or uploaded on the databases may not be used to bother, stalk, harass, threaten or embarrass any person. You may not use the Website to look up details of celebrities or other public persons, or to locate individuals under the age of 18 years. Information shall not be provided, made available or resold to any other person or entity without Tenantverify’s prior written consent. All searches on the Website are tracked, and (as also provided for below) you hereby grant your consent to such tracking and to the provision of all information about your access of the Website to law enforcement and other agencies or entities as may be necessary to respond to allegations, if any, that the information contained in the databases has been misused.</p>
  <p class="m-5 h3 text-warning">Additional Restrictions</p>
  <p class="ml-5 mr-5">In the event of you using the information contained or uploaded on our databases for criminal or civil background checks, you should not assume that this information provides complete or accurate information of such person’s criminal or civil history.

Tenantverify does not offer any legal advice on how to use the information contained in criminal or civil background reports, and is not responsible, in any way whatsoever, for any action that may be taken by you based on this information. You agree to exercise extreme caution when interpreting the results of a criminal or civil background search for any type of verification. You hereby acknowledge that positive matches in criminal or civil background checks may not provide confirmation of an individual’s criminal or civil background and further enquiries may need to be done by you to confirm this. Proper use of the information is your responsibility. The information contained in the databases has not been collected in whole or in part for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports. You shall not use any of the information as the sole factor for the purposes of (1) establishing an individual’s eligibility for personal credit or insurance or assessing risks associated with existing consumer credit obligations, (2) evaluating an individual for employment, promotion, reassignment, termination or retention (including employment of household workers such as domestic help, drivers, guards, cleaning personnel, nannies, contractors, and other individuals), or (3) any other personal or business transaction with another individual (including, but not limited to, leasing an apartment).
